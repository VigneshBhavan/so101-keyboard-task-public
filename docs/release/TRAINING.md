# Training stages, outputs and comparisons

The public entry point starts from scratch unless `--checkpoint` is supplied.
P1A trains two-letter sequences. Transit15 trains six-letter sequences with the
15 mm transit-clearance contract. Observation/action sizes remain 22/5.

## Short validation

```bash
./so101 train --actuator anchorbench --num-envs 64 --iterations 10 --seed 1307
```

One-iteration runs with four environments have been tested for both public actuator
profiles, task DR, changed nominal pose, custom solver settings and custom actuator
parameters. The 64-environment, 10-update AnchorBench quickstart and DR run also
pass, as does a short P1A-to-Transit15 resume. These runs test the pipeline, not
policy performance. First startup
compiles Warp kernels; the user-owned runtime cache reuses them on later runs.

## Train for your configured keyboard pose

After creating your task JSON as shown in the README, an example two-stage
budget is 4,000 P1A updates followed by 16,000 six-letter updates. Evaluate early
and choose the continuation budget from your results:

```bash
./so101 train --actuator anchorbench --stage p1a \
  --task-config configs/tasks/my-keyboard.json \
  --num-envs 4096 --iterations 4000 --seed 1307

# Select the final model from that run, and use the same profile/configuration.
./so101 train --actuator anchorbench --stage transit15 \
  --checkpoint /absolute/path/to/P1A/model_N.pt \
  --num-envs 4096 --iterations 16000 --seed 1307
```

This documents a runnable staged recipe, not a newly reproduced benchmark result.
The historical benchmark used qualified precursor checkpoints and specific
multi-GPU runs. The released artifact manifest records checkpoint identities. A new seed, new geometry or new precursor is a new experiment.
RSL-RL checkpoint indices are inherited on resume; use saved iteration metadata
and the request's additional-iteration budget rather than guessing update counts
from a filename. Do not select a checkpoint solely because it has the largest
number: evaluate it under the intended sequence bank and event criteria.

`--checkpoint` restores optimizer/policy state. Task/physics JSONs beside the
checkpoint under `params/` are inherited automatically; keep the same actuator
choice unless intentionally performing a separately labelled transfer experiment.
Use `--task-config` or `--physics-config` explicitly when changing the experiment.

The 4096-environment, full-budget recipe has not been rerun in the new public
container. Memory use and wall time must be measured for the recipient's GPU.
Reduce `--num-envs` if necessary, but record it: it changes samples per PPO update
and therefore the training budget. The current default is 64 environments, not a
claim that 64 reproduces the historical training setup.

## Evaluate and compare

```bash
./so101 evaluate --actuator anchorbench --stage transit15 \
  --checkpoint /absolute/path/to/model_N.pt \
  --env-config /absolute/path/to/params/env.yaml --num-envs 1024 --seed 1307
```

Use the same task, reward, observations, training sample budget, seeds, checkpoint
selection rule and evaluation sequences when comparing independently trained
actuator profiles. Keep solver comparisons separate. A fixed-policy physics
ablation is a different experiment and is not performed silently by this CLI.

Reports include exact typing, strict press/release/clearance success, wrong keys,
termination reasons and checkpoint/configuration hashes. Generated configurations
and logs live under `output/public/<timestamp>-train/rsl_rl/...`; evaluation results
live in the corresponding `*-evaluate` directory. Keep the complete `params/`
folder with each policy for replay and deployment export.

The launcher prints host paths after each run: the latest saved checkpoint and
matching environment for training, or the evaluation report and video when
produced. Use these paths in place of the examples' `/absolute/path/to/...`
placeholders. The latest checkpoint still needs evaluation before deployment.

## Supervise the staged run

For the default reference geometry, the host-side supervisor runs the same public commands sequentially and saves
stage status, console logs, evaluation reports, videos and GPU samples. Run it
inside a persistent terminal such as tmux for a long experiment:

```bash
./so101 build
python3 scripts/run_public_training_pipeline.py \
  --out-dir output/reference-training-seed1307
```

Defaults are 4096 environments, 4000 P1A updates, then 16000 additional Transit15
updates. It evaluates P1A on 1024 episodes with seed 2307 before advancing. The
default promotion threshold is 90% strict success, an engineering gate rather
than a claim of hardware readiness. A failed gate saves its report and video,
stops before Transit15, and marks `status.json` for inspection.

Transit15 is evaluated on 1024 episodes each with seeds 2307 and 3307. Export is
skipped if either evaluation fails the quality gate. For the optional deployment
step, run `./so101 setup-hardware` and calibrate your robot, then add
`--prepare-deployment --robot-id YOUR_CALIBRATED_ID`. Export and dry-run preflight
require that calibration file; this step never executes hardware motion. Recorded videos still need visual review; scalar gates
do not certify contact quality or sim-to-real transfer.

The output directory must be new. `status.json` records current stage and terminal
status; `gpu.csv` records total GPU memory/use every 10 seconds, including desktop
processes. Each stage has its own public CLI request and resolved training inputs.
For individual commands, `./so101 ... --output-dir NEW_DIRECTORY` selects an explicit
output directory instead of the default timestamped location.

For custom task/physics JSONs, use the explicit train/resume commands above; the
supervisor currently exposes the reference configuration only. Short-run results
are retained in [development validation](RESULTS.md), not as recommended policies.

## Disk, time and ownership

The measured image size is approximately 32.6 GB (30.4 GiB). Plan for at least
70 GB free across Docker storage and your workspace for layers, caches and runs;
actual peak storage depends on build cache and checkpoint retention.
First download/build and kernel compilation may take tens of minutes to hours,
depending on connection, CPU and caches; a cold-install wall time is not measured.

At the measured 36.72 seconds per 10 updates with 4096 environments, 4000 updates
extrapolate to 4.08 hours and another 16000 to 16.32 hours: about 20.4 hours total
on the RTX 5090 before startup/evaluation. This is a planning estimate, not a
completed 20,000-update timing. Evaluate early rather than assuming that budget
is necessary. Requests and exit metadata record timestamps and wall seconds;
RSL-RL console output reports training-loop time separately.

Containers run with your host UID/GID, so new checkpoints and run directories
can be edited or deleted without sudo. The writable container home/cache is
stored under `XDG_CACHE_HOME/so101-typing` (default: `~/.cache/so101-typing`).
This host cache uses additional disk space as kernels are compiled. The older
`so101-typing-warp-cache` Docker volume is no longer used. Once you have stopped
using containers from older versions, you can reclaim that volume's disk space:

```bash
docker volume rm so101-typing-warp-cache
```

Existing root-owned runs from older versions are not automatically changed; their owner must repair
permissions or remove them once.
