# Fresh-user reproduction record

Follow the repository README in a fresh clone. Record the Git commit, dataset
revision, OS, GPU, driver, Docker version, image ID and robot model/ID. Preserve
the generated request, exit, evaluation and deployment logs with the result.

## Software acceptance

1. Build with `./so101 build` using only public dependencies.
2. Run `./so101 download`; every file must pass its pinned checksum.
3. Run `./so101 probe` and the README's six-letter video command. Inspect the
   recording and strict evaluation report, including failure reasons.
4. Run the short staged recipe in [TRAINING.md](TRAINING.md), evaluate both seeds,
   and record initialization wall time separately from training-loop time.
5. Install with `./so101 setup-hardware`, export the policy under your robot ID
   with `--encoder-convention lerobot`, then dry-run deployment without `--execute`.
6. Compare the exported CPU actor to a recorded simulation trace using the
   parity command in [HARDWARE_PREPARATION.md](HARDWARE_PREPARATION.md).

For a quick installation check, use one training update before spending the
learning budget. A random startup checkpoint is not expected to type successfully.
The learned policy can also be tested with the placement configurations described
in [TASK_CONFIGURATION.md](TASK_CONFIGURATION.md).

## Operator and physical acceptance

The operator performs standard LeRobot follower calibration, checks the fixed jaw,
measures the fixture pose, and confirms model/encoder alignment before motion.
Follow the hardware guide for the explicit execution command and stop procedure.
Record attempted sequences and every wrong key, stop or failed reset, not only
successful clips. Keep new-robot results separate from the historical benchmark.

## Result template

| Item | Recipient evidence |
| --- | --- |
| Machine, GPU/driver and robot identity | Pending independent recipient |
| Git commit, dataset revision, image ID | Pending independent recipient |
| Build/download/probe and sample playback | Pending independent recipient |
| Training budget, wall time and loop time | Pending independent recipient |
| Seeded strict evaluation and video review | Pending independent recipient |
| Export, dry run and CPU parity | Pending independent recipient |
| Calibration and measured alignment | Pending operator |
| Physical attempts, successes and failures | Pending operator |

A local clean-checkout test is useful software evidence but does not fill this
independent-recipient record or establish physical success on another SO-101.
